## Quick Notes (manual)
Use this space for anything you want to tell me before we start working in a new session.  
For example:
- Current goal
- Issues you’ve noticed
- Tabs you have open (Vercel, Render, GitHub, etc.)

## About RamRoots
RamRoots is a personal AI super-app built to act as a:
- **Personal assistant** (organizer, researcher, communicator)
- **Engineer/developer** (can help build and maintain itself)
- **Automation hub** (connects with external services and APIs)
- **Permanent memory store** (recalls past conversations and files)

The project is under active development and integrates:
- Frontend: **React + Vite + TailwindCSS**
- Backend: **Node.js/Express**
- Custom memory manager
- API endpoints for AI tools and file handling

## How This README Works
This file will be updated automatically:
1. **Status section** (`<!-- STATUS-START -->` … `<!-- STATUS-END -->`) will refresh with live deployment and build info.
2. You can manually update the “Quick Notes” before sending me the ZIP so I instantly know what’s happening.
