# RamRoot Build Master Checklist

## Purpose
This document contains the complete roadmap for building RamRoot from its current state to:
1. **ChatGPT+ Level** ‚Äì capable of everything ChatGPT can do (reasoning, research, coding, writing) PLUS memory, live data, and automation.  
2. **Self-Expanding Level** ‚Äì capable of finishing the build on its own and adding new capabilities without human intervention.

## PHASE 1 ‚Äì REACH CHATGPT+ LEVEL (Doesn‚Äôt Need ChatGPT Anymore)

### 1. Core Brain Integration
- [ ] Set up **API keys** for:
  - GPT-4o / GPT-5 (OpenAI)
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
  - Perplexity API (Pro)
- [ ] Implement **Task Router**:
  - Route reasoning/creativity ‚Üí GPT-4o/GPT-5
  - Route long/accurate analysis ‚Üí Claude 3.5
  - Route live web lookups ‚Üí Perplexity
- [ ] Test each API separately, then test routing.

**Expected Result:**  
RamRoot can answer anything ChatGPT can, plus pull real-time info with sources.

---

### 2. Permanent Memory System
- [ ] Choose and set up a **Vector Database**:
  - Pinecone (paid, easy) or Weaviate/Milvus (self-hosted, free)
- [ ] Create **memory schema**:
  - `profile` ‚Äì user facts, preferences, contacts
  - `projects` ‚Äì current and past work
  - `rules` ‚Äì operational guidelines
  - `knowledge` ‚Äì custom knowledge base (genealogy, bids, designs, etc.)
- [ ] Implement memory retrieval and updating with embeddings.
- [ ] Load initial data from existing notes, files, and instructions.

**Expected Result:**  
RamRoot remembers everything you‚Äôve told it permanently and recalls it in conversation.

---

### 3. Tool Layer
- [ ] Add **file handling**:
  - Read/write PDF, Excel, CSV, DOCX
  - Summarize or extract data
- [ ] Add **calculators & converters** for math, units, dates
- [ ] Add **image tools** (optional: OCR, resizing, annotations)
- [ ] Integrate with browser or HTTP client for external data pulls.

**Expected Result:**  
RamRoot can process, create, and modify real documents/images ‚Äî not just text.

---

### 4. Automation Hooks
- [ ] Connect to **Zapier** (paid) or **n8n** (free/self-hosted)
- [ ] Set up:
  - Email sending/reading
  - Google Sheets/Excel updates
  - Calendar events/reminders
  - CRM or business app connections
- [ ] Secure with permissions so it only acts on approved workflows.

**Expected Result:**  
RamRoot can take action in the real world (send messages, update files, manage schedules).

---

### 5. Reasoning & Self-Check Loop
- [ ] Add multi-step process for complex queries:
  - Step 1: Plan solution
  - Step 2: Execute solution
  - Step 3: Self-critique output
  - Step 4: Refine & finalize
- [ ] Allow fallback to another model if confidence is low.

**Expected Result:**  
Higher accuracy, fewer mistakes, and self-improvement without you prompting it.

---

**‚úÖ Completion of Phase 1 means RamRoot can:**
- Outperform ChatGPT in practical tasks
- Remember and use your personal/business context
- Access live, up-to-date information
- Automate workflows
- Self-correct and improve answers

---

## PHASE 2 ‚Äì SELF-EXPANDING RAMROOT (Finishes Build Itself)

### 6. Self-Direction Engine
- [ ] Give RamRoot access to its own `README.md` build plan.
- [ ] Add ‚Äútask discovery‚Äù ability:
  - Identify missing features
  - Break them into subtasks
  - Schedule execution
- [ ] Add ability to pull its own code snippets from web/GitHub.

---

### 7. Continuous Learning
- [ ] Weekly knowledge refresh via:
  - Web crawling trusted sources
  - Scraping relevant documents
  - Storing updates in vector DB
- [ ] Create ‚ÄúRamRoot Knowledge Packs‚Äù for law, medicine, engineering, etc.

---

### 8. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- [ ] Spin up specialized RamRoot ‚Äúagents‚Äù for:
  - Legal research
  - Scientific analysis
  - Engineering & design
  - Business operations
- [ ] Orchestrate them with a manager agent.

---

### 9. Full Autonomy
- [ ] Implement approval system (can toggle off for full autonomy)
- [ ] Allow RamRoot to:
  - Write and run its own code updates
  - Add new APIs/tools without manual setup
  - Maintain & optimize its own infrastructure

---

**üöÄ Final Expected Result:**  
RamRoot evolves beyond ChatGPT capabilities, maintains itself, adds new features, and operates independently in all business and research tasks.

---

## NOTES
- This plan should always remain in `README.md` for reference.
- Each completed step should be checked off.
- Phase 1 completion = You can stop using ChatGPT entirely.
- Phase 2 completion = RamRoot finishes building itself.
