RamRoot Autonomous Build Plan
Plan Created: 8-12-25

Instructions
These steps are in order.
If any of these steps have already been completed in the files, skip directly to the next step.
The goal is to reach Full Autonomy — where RamRoot can add new features, debug, deploy, and upgrade itself without manual intervention.

Step 1 — Full File Access
Enable RamRoot to read, write, edit, and create its own files on the server or local environment.

Implement secure sandboxing so changes can be tested before going live.

Step 2 — GitHub + Auto-Deploy Hooks
Give RamRoot the ability to commit code changes to GitHub automatically.

Add post-commit hooks to deploy automatically to Vercel and Render.

Step 3 — Self-Test & Rollback
Build a test suite to check new changes before deploying.

Add an automatic rollback system if tests fail or the build breaks.

Step 4 — API Integration Framework
Create a simple way for RamRoot to add new APIs (car scanner, genealogy, email assistant, etc.) by itself.

Include automated API key management and config file updates.

Step 5 — Permanent Long-Term Memory
Install a database or memory.json system that persists data forever.

Ensure memory is loaded at startup and updated in real time.

Step 6 — Self-Coding Capability
Enable RamRoot to:

Receive a user request for a new feature

Write the code

Save it

Test it

Deploy it without human assistance

Example: “Add a genealogy feature” → RamRoot writes it, installs dependencies, and makes it live.

Step 7 — Expansion & Optimization
Once autonomy is achieved, optimize for speed, security, and resource efficiency.

Continuously expand capabilities (voice control, image editing, automotive diagnostics, etc.) as requested.

✅ End Goal:
When all steps are complete, RamRoot will operate independently, able to add any new feature or upgrade entirely on its own.
