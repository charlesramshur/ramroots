Here is a simple example of a `editor.jsx` file. In this example, the editor is basically a textarea, which updates its value when you type into it.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Editor extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { content: '' };

        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }

    handleChange(event) {
        this.setState({ content: event.target.value });
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="editor">
                <textarea value={this.state.content} onChange={this.handleChange} />
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Editor;
```

In the above code, `<Editor />` is a React component that has a `state` object with a `content` property. The `handleChange` method sets the `content` property to the value of the textarea whenever it changes, using the `setState` method, which tells React to re-render the component. In the `render` method, a textarea is returned, with its `value` attribute set to `this.state.content` and its `onChange` event handler set to `this.handleChange`. When you type into the textarea, it updates the `content` property of the `state` object, which in turn updates the value of the textarea.
