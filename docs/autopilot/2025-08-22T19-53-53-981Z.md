# CI Smoke: Trigger Existing Workflows

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to trigger existing Continuous Integration (CI) workflows in our repository. The goal is to ensure that all workflows are executed correctly and that the CI pipeline is functioning as expected.

## Steps to Trigger Workflows

1. **Check Existing Workflows**: First, verify the existing workflows defined in the `.github/workflows` directory. Each workflow is defined in a YAML file.

   Example of a workflow file:
   ```yaml
   name: CI Workflow

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run tests
           run: npm test
   ```

2. **Trigger Workflows Manually**: You can manually trigger workflows by pushing changes to the specified branches or by creating a pull request. For example, to trigger the `CI Workflow`, push a commit to the `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Trigger CI workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor Workflow Execution**: After triggering the workflows, monitor their execution in the GitHub Actions tab of your repository. Ensure that all jobs complete successfully.

4. **Review Logs**: If any workflow fails, review the logs provided in the GitHub Actions interface to identify and resolve issues.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively trigger and monitor existing CI workflows in our repository. This ensures that our codebase remains stable and that all changes are validated through automated testing.
