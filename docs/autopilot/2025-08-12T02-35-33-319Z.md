# CI and Automerge Status

As of [insert date], Continuous Integration (CI) and automerge features have been successfully enabled for this repository. This enhancement aims to streamline our development workflow and ensure that code changes are automatically tested and merged when they meet the defined criteria.

## CI Configuration

The CI pipeline is configured to run tests on every pull request. This ensures that all code changes are validated before they are merged into the main branch. The CI setup includes:

- **Automated Testing**: All tests are executed to verify the integrity of the code.
- **Linting**: Code style checks are performed to maintain code quality.
- **Build Verification**: The build process is validated to ensure that the application compiles successfully.

### Example CI Configuration (YAML)

Here is a simplified example of the CI configuration:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

## Automerge Configuration

The automerge feature is configured to automatically merge pull requests that pass all CI checks and meet the required review criteria. This helps in reducing the manual overhead of merging and allows for a more efficient workflow.

### Automerge Settings

- **Merge Criteria**: Pull requests must pass all tests and receive at least one approval.
- **Merge Method**: Squash merging is enabled to maintain a clean commit history.

For any questions or further details regarding the CI and automerge setup, please refer to the repository's documentation or reach out to the development team.
